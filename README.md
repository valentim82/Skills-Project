# Skills-Project

Our client, Halifax Canoe and Kayak would like a new website. Obviously, they want it to work across a myriad of devices. They would eventually like the ability to post information about upcoming adventures and allow visitors to register for trips, that will be Project 2 and 3. 

For Project 1, it is your job to build them a fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
